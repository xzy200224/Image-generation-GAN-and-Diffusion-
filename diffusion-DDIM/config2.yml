### model params
Model:

  num_res_blocks: 2
  dropout: 0.1

### dataset params
Dataset:
  # Deciding which dataset to use, must be one of {'mnist', 'cifar', 'custom'}.
  dataset: "mnist"  # Change from "cifar" to "mnist"
  # If mnist and cifar datasets, whether to use the training set.
  train: True
  # Folder of data sets. When `dataset = custom`, this parameter can be a list with different folders.
  # Then all images in the list with suffixes in `suffix` in the folder will be loaded.
  data_path: "./data/"
  # If mnist and cifar datasets, whether to download it.
  download: True
  # If mnist dataset, image_size is [28, 28]. If cifar dataset, image_size is [32, 32]. If custom, specify as needed.
  image_size: [28, 28]  # Change from [32, 32] to [28, 28] for MNIST
  # If custom dataset, what is the mode of the image. must be one of {'RGB', 'L', 'CMYK'}.
  mode: "L"  # Change from "RGB" to "L" for grayscale images
  # If custom dataset, decide what suffix to load for the image.
  suffix: ["png", "jpg"]  # This is not applicable for MNIST, but keeping it here for completeness
